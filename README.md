# film-selector

Project-Name : Bubble-Cinema

This app is meant to deal an actual problem during lockdown / shutdown within my Bubble. 
We want to keep track of what movies to watch together. 
This app is meant to allow people to search for movies, add them to the list to watch, add an anticipaton note.
At the end it produces a list, taking consideration of the anticipation of every member of the bubble to help select the next movie to watch together.
